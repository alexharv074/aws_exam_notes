SSE

SSE-S3 requires that Amazon S3 manage the data and master encryption keys.
SSE-C requires that you manage the encryption key.
SSE-KMS requires that AWS manage the data key but you manage the master key in AWS KMS.

Storage Gateway

File Gateway (NFS) - flat files stored in S3
Volume Gateway (iSCSI)
- Stored Volumes - dataset stored on site async backed up to S3.
- Cached Volumes - dataset stored in S3 and frequently accessed data stored on site.

EBS

Elastic Block Storage (EBS).

Types:

GP2
- balances price and performance.
- 3 IOPS per GB up to 10000 IOPS and burst to +3000 IOPS.

Provisioned IOPS
- for IO intensive e.g. NoSQL > 10000 IOPS.
- 20000 IOPS per volume.

Volumes exist on EBS / Snapshots on S3.

Snapshots:
- incremental

Root FS EBS Snapshots:
- stop the instance before taking the snapshot.
- take a snap while the instance is running.
- create AMIs from EBS-backed instances AND snapshots.
- can change the EBS size & type on the fly.
- volumes in the same AZ as the EC2 instance.
- snapshots of encrypted volumes are also encrypted.

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
- Designed for high-throughput MapReduce, Kafka, ETL, log processing, and data warehouse workloads

Cold HDD (sc1)
- Designed for workloads similar to those for Throughput Optimized HDD that are accessed less frequently
