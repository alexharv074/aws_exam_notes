Create VPC

Auto-creates:
- Route Table
- Network ACL
- Security Group

Must then create subnets per AZ.

Then create IGW.
- note only 1 IGW per VPC is possible.

Every subnet by default is associated with the main route table.
Therefore, the main route table should not access the Internet.

Create an Internet-facing route table: 0.0.0.0/0 => IGW.

DNS Names
- enableDnsHostnames: false by default

VPCs can be extended by associating a secondary CIDR since Aug 2017. This leads to a second entry for local in the main route table.

---

NAT Instance (deprecated)
- Just launch an EC2 instance and put it in a SG.
- Disable src/dst check.
- Create a route out of the PRIVATE subnet from default route table via NAT instance in the PUBLIC subet: 0.0.0.0/0 => NAT instance.

Note that the NAT instance is a SPOF. Note also that the INSTANCE TYPE can be a bottleneck.

HA can be made via ASGs + multiple subnets in AZs + script to automate failover.

NAT Gateway
- NAT Gateway: IPv4
- egress only Gateway: IPv6
- Note it is auto-assigned a public IP (EIP).
- Create a route out from default route table via NAT gateway: 0.0.0.0/0 => NAT gateway.

Features:
- Scale up to 10Gbps.
- Not associated with a SG.

NAT Gateway v IGW.
- IGWs are for 2-way traffic, NAT Gateways are for egress-only.

NAT Gateways do NOT have security groups.

NACLs

Default ACL in a VPC allows all in/out bound.
Custom ACL by default denies all in/out bound.
Each Subnet is associated with exactly one ACL, by default the default ACL.
Stateless == every request subject to rules for in/out bound.

---

ALBs

ALB must be in at least 2 public subnets.

---

VPC Flow Logs

Captures all IP traffic to/from NICs in your VPC.
Data is available in Cloudwatch.

Can be created at 3 levels:
- VPC
- Subnet
- NIC level

Your VPCs > Actions > Create Flow Log

These can be streamed to Lambda or Amazon Elasticsearch service.

Flow Logs cannot be enabled for a peered VPC unless it is in your account.
Cannot tag a Flow Log.
You cannot change a Flow Log's configuration.
Not all traffic is monitored, e.g. DNS traffic, DHCP traffic, Windows License activation traffic, 169.254.169.254 traffic, traffic to the reserved IP of VPC router

---

VPC End Points

Comes in 2 varieties:
- Interface end points
- Gateway end points

Limitations:
- VPC End Points do not support cross-region S3 requests. VPC & S3 must be in the same region.
- Only IPv4.
- You cannot use a prefix list ID in an outbound rule in a network ACL to allow or deny outbound traffic to the service specified in an endpoint.
- You can't tag an endpoint.

They have a policy by default that allows all actions on all S3 buckets.
