DNS

Alias records:
- ELBs do not have IPv4 addresses. Due to Amazon magic and Alias records.
- Aliases can be used for "naked domain names" or "domain apex" and CNAMEs can't.

Weighting policies:
- Simple Routing
- Wighted Routing
- Latency-based Routing
- Failover Routing
- Geolocation Routing
- Multi-value Routing

Simple
- (Default) Best for 1 resource for 1 function e.g. 1 webserver.

Weighted
- Set static weights on all routes.
- Used for Blue/Green.

Latency
- Allow the latency of the connection to determine the route.

Failover
- Set up Active/Passive routing. Active always used unless there's an outage on that link.
- Uses a Health Check to determine if the link is alive.

Geolocation
- Route all requests to a local resource based on the requester's geolocation.
- Recommended to create a default record set.

Multi-value
