Kinesis

What is streaming data?

Generated continuously by thousands of data sources, e.g. social network data, game data, etc.

Kinesis is a platform to send streaming data to. 

3 services:
- Kinesis Streams
- Kinesis Firehose
- Kinesis Analytics

Producers => Streams => Consumers => Store e.g. EMR, Redshift etc

OR

Producers => Firehose => S3

Main difference, Firehose is more automated.

Kinesis Analytics allows SQL queries on Kinesis Streams.

Can preprocess data using Lambda:

Encryption:

Server-side encryption is a feature in Amazon Kinesis Data Streams that automatically encrypts data before it's at rest by using an AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) you specify.

Shards:

A shard is a uniquely identified sequence of data records in a stream. A stream is composed of one or more shards, each of which provides a fixed unit of capacity.

You can guarantee ordering within a shard but not across multiple shards.
