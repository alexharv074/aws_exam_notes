# DynamoDB

## Associate notes

Fast - single-digit millisecond latency.
Supports document and key-value.

Stored on SSD storage. Spread across 3 "geographically distinct data centres" - for some reasons, they won't say across 3 AZs.

Consistency models:
- eventual consistent reads. Usually within 1 second.
- strongly consistent reads.

Pricing model is complicated

DynamoDB Streams:
"DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table, and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours."

## Quick facts

- SSD
- 3 "geographically distinct regions"

Eventual consistency reads - consistency across all copies reached in &lt; 1 second.
Strongly consistent reads - always get the right answer at the expense of performance.

Consists of:

- Tables
- Items (like a row)
- Attributes (like a column)

Pricing:

- write throughput $0.0065 / hour for every 10 units
- read throughput $0.0065 / hour for every 50 units

First 25GB per month is free.
$0.25GB per month thereafter.

Write Capacity Unit
- 1 WCU = 1 write / second 

Free tier:
- 25 Read Capacity Units
- 25 Write Capacity Units

## Indexes and Streams

Primary keys

- Single Attribute: Parition Key (aka Hash Key) composed of one attribute.
- Composite Attribute: (e.g. unique ID + date) composed of two attributes.

The primary key for this table consists of Artist (partition key) and SongTitle (sort key).

Partition:

> DynamoDB stores data in partitions. A partition is an allocation of storage for a table, backed by solid-state drives (SSDs) and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones within an AWS Region. Partition management is handled entirely by DynamoDBâ€”you never have to manage partitions yourself.

([ref](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.Partitions.html)).

## Scan v Query API call

### Query

A Query operation finds items in a table using only the primary key. You must provide the partition name.
Optionally provide a sort key.

To reverse the order, set the *ScanIndexForward* parameter to false.

*ConsistentRead*
Determines the read consistency model: If set to true, then the operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, the operation uses eventually consistent reads.

### Scan

Scan examines every item in the table. But can use *ProjectionExpression* to limit it.
Less efficient than a Query.

## Provisioned throughput

Using the AWS portal, you are trying to Scale DynamoDB past its preconfigured maximums. You can increase provisioned throughput limits by raising a ticket to AWS support.

### Read throughput

Magic formula:

- (Size of read to nearest 4KB / 4) * no of items = read throughput
- divide by 2 if eventually consistent.

Example question:

> You have an application that requires:
>   read 10 items
>   of 1KB / second
> using
>   eventual consistency.
> What do you set the read throughput to?

- Size of read to nearest 4KB is 4 / 4 = *1 read unit per item*
- 10 items = 10
- For eventual consistency 10 / 2 = *4 units of read throughput*

### Write throughput

Writes always 1KB in size and 1 write per second.

> You have an application that requires:
>   write 12 items
>   100KB / second per item.
> What do you set the write throughput to?

12 items * 100KB = 1200 *write units*

### exceed provisioned throughput

HTTP 400 and *ProvsionedThroughputExceededException*.

## Conditional write

To prevent a race condition where two users write to the same item with different values at the same time. Conditional writes are *idempotent*.

## Atomic counters

Increment a counter no matter what using the *UpdateItem* operation. These are not idempotent.

## Batch operations

Use *BatchGetItem*, can return up to 16MB of data / 100 items. Note no s.

## PutItem

Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item.

## Other stuff

- Maximum size of a shard
- Maximum amount of data per primary key
